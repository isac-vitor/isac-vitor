# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Isac Vitor Silva and my nickname is "isac-vitor"!

- I am studying ADS 'Systems Analysis and Development' at EstÃ¡cio De SÃ¡ College and I expect to finish in July 2026.
- I also study a course called Alura, which is recognized throughout Brazil.
- Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in Python, focusing on building a strong foundation for real-world applications, automation, and web development. At the same time, I'm also exploring JavaScript to broaden my understanding of frontend development and modern web interactions.
